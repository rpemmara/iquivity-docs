content manager.
```

- Not saved to conversation history
- Disappears after session ends
- Content may appear in content manager
- Useful for sensitive queries

### When to Use Temporary Chats

**Use Cases:**

**1. Confidential Information**
```
Example:
"Analyze this confidential contract [upload]"
"Review salary negotiation strategy"
"Process sensitive customer data"
```

**2. One-Time Queries**
```
Example:
"Quick fact check on competitor"
"Test a prompt idea"
"Personal advice"
```

**3. Experimental Prompts**
```
Example:
"Testing different writing styles"
"Comparing model outputs"
"Trying new approaches"
```

**4. Privacy-Sensitive Topics**
```
Example:
"Personal health questions"
"Financial planning scenarios"
"Private research"
```
