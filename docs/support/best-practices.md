## AI Content Generation

### Writing Effective Prompts

The quality of AI output depends heavily on your prompts.

#### Prompt Formula

```
Context + Task + Format + Constraints + Examples = Perfect Prompt
```

**Example:**

❌ **Bad Prompt:**
```
"Write about marketing"
```

✅ **Good Prompt:**
```
"As a B2B SaaS marketing expert, write a 500-word blog post about
email marketing automation for small business owners. Use a friendly
but professional tone. Include 3 specific benefits with real-world
examples. Target audience: non-technical business owners with limited
marketing experience."
```

#### Prompt Best Practices

**1. Be Specific**
- State exactly what you want
- Include details about length, tone, audience
- Specify format and structure

**2. Provide Context**
- Who is the audience?
- What is the purpose?
- Where will this be used?

**3. Set Constraints**
- Word count or length limits
- Tone and style requirements
- What to include/exclude
- Format requirements

**4. Use Examples**
- Show the style you want
- Reference similar content
- Describe the desired outcome

**5. Iterate**
- Start with base prompt
- Refine based on results
- Save successful prompts

### Optimizing Content Quality

**Review and Edit**
- Never use AI content without review
- Always fact-check information
- Add your personal touch
- Verify accuracy

**Use the Right Tone**
```
Professional: Business documents, proposals, reports
Casual: Social media, blog posts, emails
Friendly: Customer communications, welcome messages
Formal: Legal documents, academic writing
Creative: Marketing copy, storytelling
```

**Specify Your Audience**
- General public
- Industry professionals
- Technical experts
- Beginners
- Executives
- Students

**Leverage Templates**
- Start with proven templates
- Customize for your needs
- Create custom templates for reuse
- Share best templates with team

## Credit Optimization

### Save Credits Strategically

**1. Use Appropriate Settings**
- Don't use "long" if "medium" suffices
- Start with standard resolution for images
- Use lower creativity for straightforward content

**2. Batch Similar Tasks**
- Generate multiple variations at once
- More efficient than individual requests
- Use bulk operations when available

**3. Refine Prompts First**
- Test with short outputs first
- Perfect your prompt before full generation
- Use test mode if available

**4. Use Improve Features Wisely**
- Edit specific sections instead of regenerating all
- Use "Improve" on paragraphs vs entire document
- Selective enhancements save credits

**5. Leverage Templates**
- Templates are optimized for efficiency
- Pre-tested prompts use fewer credits
- Consistent results with less trial and error

### Credit Usage Guidelines

**Cost-Effective Operations:**
```
✅ Use templates (optimized prompts)
✅ Edit and improve sections (vs full regeneration)
✅ Standard image resolution for drafts
✅ Shorter content for testing
✅ Batch operations
```

**Credit-Intensive Operations:**
```
⚠️  Ultra-high resolution images
⚠️  Long-form video generation
⚠️  Multiple variations without batching
⚠️  Regenerating entire documents
⚠️  Maximum creativity settings
```
